# Analysis-and-Design

The problem addressed in these projects was understanding and applying data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage and manipulate data. In Project One, I analyzed the theoretical performance of different data structures by calculating their run-time and memory complexity, learning that the choice of data structure is critical to a program's efficiency. In Project Two I applied this knowledge by implementing a sorting algorithm to organize a list of courses, demonstrating a practical application of these concepts. A major roadblock I encountered was mastering the abstract nature of Big O notation, which I overcame through breaking down operations step by step. This work has really expanded my approach to designing and developing software. I now prioritize data organization before coding, which has led me to write programs that are not only functional but also more maintainable, readable and adaptable to future changes.
